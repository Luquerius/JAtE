#Black Cross

black_cross_DESC;The Black Cross are a loosely organized collective of insular communities, travelling bard-preachers, and militant heresiarchs who share a belief in the “Straight-Edged Path” in rebellion against a figure only known as “the Man”, who they believe imprisoned the mother-goddesses Anarkee and Gaia in the Event. The Straight-Edged Path mandates abstination from drugs, alcohol, and premarital sex, a path that they believe will lead to freeing of the Mothers from the Man’s control. Black Crossers bear a particular opposition to the rearing of livestock, and often seek to destroy the practice through force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Refulgents see themselves as stewards, seeking to maintain balance with the world around them by carefully tending to Fire, feeding it that which is necessary so that it may do its work but containing it from spreading wantonly. Fire destroys all in it's path but in doing so gives room for new life to grow strong, this cycle is vital to Refulgents, who see it as the truest law of nature, the old dies so that the new can thrive. They extend this law to themselves in the form of complex rituals, where they build effigies and temples and burn them to symbolically cleanse themselves as the land around them is cleansed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Adventist
#Their localization exists elsewhere already so yee haw
adventist;Adventist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
adventist_DESC;These are the followers of a most unusual Guru, Guru Miller. They believe that Christ is judging all people actively, and has been since before the event, in preparation of his coming. Unlike the Postadventists, whose movement swept through the lands of the far east, these Adventists do not believe that the Event was Christ’s judgement of the world – and denounce the concept as a most vile deception. They also observe the Sabbath of the Jews, instead of that of their fellow Christians, and believe that death is a dreamless sleep, that only the faithful will ever awaken from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Baptist
#Their localization exists elsewhere already so yee haw
baptist;Baptist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
baptist_DESC;The Baptists have always held a prominent position in America, and they persisted in their beliefs through the apocalypse. Their defining creed being that one must choose to follow Christ – they cannot simply be born into it. They practice baptism, by immersion, but only for the believer – and can an infant be said to be a believer in anything? The teachings of many Gurus are allowed within their walls, to help every man find their own path to Christ, through their own reading of scripture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Congregationalist
#Their localization exists elsewhere already so yee haw
congregationalist;Conregationalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
congregationalist_DESC;These Congregationalists reject the Baptist church, and all organized churches, as inherently being infringements on the believer’s ability to find their own path to Christ in the scriptures alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Pentecostal
#Their localization exists elsewhere already
pentecostal;Pentecostal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pentecostal_DESC;In the wake of the event, a Guru lost to time spoke of the need for those who recognized the Charismata of the modern day to band together in their time of crisis, founding a unified church for the faithful. Rebirth, Sanctification, and for many of the lucky faithful, the True Baptism of Fire would evidence a man’s journey towards perfection in God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Oneness
#Their localization exists elsewhere already
oneness;Oneness;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
oneness_DESC;Some who profess faith in the modern Charismata rejected the Holy Trinity, held fast to by the vast majority of Christian faithful, as little more than polytheism. They believe that Christ is One, not Three, and that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are merely titles, not “persons.” They were rejected by the Charismatic Guru’s new church, and so they have formed their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Holiness

#Freighter
freighter;Freighter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
freighter_DESC;Long before the Event sank old America into the state of warfare and infighting that is witnessed today, the Freighters stood guard over the ports of the West Coast, and protected the exotic goods and tools from around the world that allowed the old Americans to live their luxurious, pampered lives. However, even as the lives of untold millions are unsteadied in the current age, nobles and commoners alike still depend on the flow of trade, however fickle, trickling in from across the Pacific to improve their meager livelihoods. Thus, the Freighters stubbornly hold onto their old posts, claiming that they alone possess the knowledge and skills to protect the ocean trade, for they have done so since time immemorial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

sikh_DESC;Coming from the land of the Punjab in the distant land of Bharata, the Sikh religion sees itself as the universal religion that teaches the ultimate truth of god and unifies all believers, freeing them from falsehood.  The Sikhs follow a succession of 10 Gurus, with the line ending at the living guru in the form of the Guru Granth Sahib. Sikhs uphold a rigid code of conduct which includes wearing symbolic articles called the "five K's" and following the four prohibitions which make one into a Khalsa, a true member of the Sikh community.

legislative_DESC;After the event, those who sought to maintain the structures of the old provincial government became know as the Legislators. They maintain some semblance of democratic processes in Victoria out of their old seat of government, The Ledge. Despite their relative stability and dominance on the islands, they have had troubles bringing the many fractured realms and peoples of old Bee-Sea back into the fold. Legislators believe that only through the authority and mandate derived from The Crown can they find stability and prosperity. Legislative realms focus many of their resources on their fleets and navies, seeing the Salish Sea as the lifeblood of their civilization. They tend to be very decentralized in their way of life; leaving individual communities largely to govern themselves, and valuing the diversity within their lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

theosophy_DESC;The Theosophists are the followers of the Guru Krishnamurti, a renowned sage who was said to be the last in a long line of Masters that shepherded the spiritual and intellectual development of humanity. According to their teachings, it was when the world closed their hearts to the lessons of Krishnamurti that mankind grew distant from Nature and Truth, relying more and more upon the various systems that they used to build the Old World, before collapsing under the burden of ignorance and desire that it carried upon its back. Numerous legends even hold that Krishnamurti himself was alive to witness the Event, spending his final years guiding the Theosophists through those dark days of turmoil and uncertainty. The Theosophists de emphasize the importance of organized religion, scripture, ritual, and hierarchy as a source of direct enlightenment, viewing them simply as roads for every individual to access the source of Truth. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

They believe laws and morals were suggestions, their honor and pride shapes them, and they are exempt if some good is done. They’re a brutal caste of tyrants, idolizing feats of bravery as sung in Los Corridos. But the Event robbed their trade routes and their clients, and now their power wanes.
