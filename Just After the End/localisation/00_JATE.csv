black_cross_DESC;The Black Cross are a loosely organized collective of insular communities, travelling bard-preachers, and militant heresiarchs who share a belief in the “Straight-Edged Path” in rebellion against a figure only known as “the Man”, who they believe imprisoned the mother-goddesses Anarkee and Gaia in the Event. The Straight-Edged Path mandates abstination from drugs, alcohol, and premarital sex, a path that they believe will lead to freeing of the Mothers from the Man’s control. Black Crossers bear a particular opposition to the rearing of livestock, and often seek to destroy the practice through force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Refulgents

Refulgents see themselves as stewards, seeking to maintain balance with the world around them by carefully tending to Fire, feeding it that which is necessary so that it may do its work but containing it from spreading wantonly. Fire destroys all in it's path but in doing so gives room for new life to grow strong, this cycle is vital to Refulgents, who see it as the truest law of nature, the old dies so that the new can thrive. They extend this law to themselves in the form of complex rituals, where they build effigies and temples and burn them to symbolically cleanse themselves as the land around them is cleansed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

adventist;Adventist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
adventist_DESC;These are the followers of a most unusual Guru, Guru Miller. They believe that Christ is judging all people actively, and has been since before the event, in preparation of his coming. Unlike the Postadventists, whose movement swept through the lands of the far east, these Adventists do not believe that the Event was Christ’s judgement of the world – and denounce the concept as a most vile deception. They also observe the Sabbath of the Jews, instead of that of their fellow Christians, and believe that death is a dreamless sleep, that only the faithful will ever awaken from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Maso Bwikwam
maso_bwikwam;Maso Bwikwam;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Other unique beliefs include the idea that flowers grew from the blood shed at crucifixion, making them highly revered in Yaqui society, and the many societies which each have their own part in the rituals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Baptist
#Their localization exists elsewhere already so yee haw
baptist;Baptist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
baptist_DESC;The Baptists have always held a prominent position in America, and they persisted in their beliefs through the apocalypse. Their defining creed being that one must choose to follow Christ – they cannot simply be born into it. They practice baptism, by immersion, but only for the believer – and can an infant be said to be a believer in anything? The teachings of many Gurus are allowed within their walls, to help every man find their own path to Christ, through their own reading of scripture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Congregationalist
#Their localization exists elsewhere already so yee haw
congregationalist;Conregationalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Pentecostal
#Their localization exists elsewhere already
pentecostal;Pentecostal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pentecostal_DESC;In the wake of the event, a Guru lost to time spoke of the need for those who recognized the Charismata of the modern day to band together in their time of crisis, founding a unified church for the faithful. Rebirth, Sanctification, and for many of the lucky faithful, the True Baptism of Fire would evidence a man’s journey towards perfection in God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Oneness
#Their localization exists elsewhere already
oneness;Oneness;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
oneness_DESC;Some who profess faith in the modern Charismata rejected the Holy Trinity, held fast to by the vast majority of Christian faithful, as little more than polytheism. They believe that Christ is One, not Three, and that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are merely titles, not “persons.” They were rejected by the Charismatic Guru’s new church, and so they have formed their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Holiness

#Freighter
freighter;Freighter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
freighter_DESC;Long before the Event sank old America into the state of warfare and infighting that is witnessed today, the Freighters stood guard over the ports of the West Coast, and protected the exotic goods and tools from around the world that allowed the old Americans to live their luxurious, pampered lives. However, even as the lives of untold millions are unsteadied in the current age, nobles and commoners alike still depend on the flow of trade, however fickle, trickling in from across the Pacific to improve their meager livelihoods. Thus, the Freighters stubbornly hold onto their old posts, claiming that they alone possess the knowledge and skills to protect the ocean trade, for they have done so since time immemorial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
